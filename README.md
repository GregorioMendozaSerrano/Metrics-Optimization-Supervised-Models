# **Practical Exercise. Analysis of Metrics for Optimizing Supervised Regression and Classification Models**

## **Author: Gregorio Mendoza Serrano**
In this practical exercise, we will study how to use the metrics previously studied in theory to solve practical problems.

The competencies associated with these teaching units are as follows:

- Students should have the ability to gather and interpret relevant data to make judgments that include reflection in the field of machine learning.

- Design an experimental framework considering the most appropriate methods for data capture, processing, storage, analysis, and visualization.

- Combine mathematical, statistical, and programming fundamentals to develop solutions to problems in the field of data science.

The objectives we aim to achieve with this practical notebook are:

- Gain a clear understanding of the metrics that measure the performance of supervised machine learning models for regression and classification.

- Work on related points in machine learning, such as cross-validation, overfitting/underfitting issues, and data balancing problems.

- Work with, understand, evaluate, compare, and interpret the main metrics in different machine learning algorithms for regression and classification applied to real-world problems.
